-- SUMMARY --

Drupal Administration Menu is re-building and automagically slicing the whole
menu tree below /admin including all invisible local tasks into the Drupal
Administration Menu. So administrators need less time to access pages which
are only visible after one or two clicks normally.

-- REQUIREMENTS --

None.


-- INSTALLATION --

* Copy admin_menu module to your modules directory and enable it on the admin
  modules page.

* Drupal 4.7: If "Admin Menu Block" is not automatically activated after module
  installation, make sure you visit the block configuration page (admin/block)
  for each theme you want to have admin_menu activated for.


-- CUSTOMIZATION --

* You have two options to override the admin menu icon:
  
  1) Disable it via CSS in your theme:

     body #admin_menu_icon { display: none; }

  2) Alter the image by overriding the theme function:

     Copy the whole function theme_admin_menu_icon() into your template.php,
     rename it to f.e. phptemplate_admin_menu_icon() and customize the output.


-- TROUBLESHOOTING --

* If your theme uses absolute or fixed positioned elements, and the default
  margin-top for <BODY> is not sufficient, you need to override admin_menu's
  stylesheet in your theme.

* If menu entries in admin_menu are rendered behind a flash movie object, you
  need to add the following property to your flash object:
<code>
<param name="wmode" value="transparent" />
</code>

-- FAQ --

Q: After upgrading to 5.x-1.2, admin_menu disappeared. Why?

A: Prior to release 5.x-1.2, Drupal Administration Menu was output in a block.
   Since 5.x-1.2, it is output via hook_footer(). Some custom themes may not
   (yet) output $closure, so admin_menu could no longer be displayed. If you
   decided to move the 'administer' tree into a new menu and disabled that menu
   block, a site could become (temporarily) unmaintainable. Either way, you
   should fix your theme by adding the following code in front of the closing
   HTML (</html>) tag:
<code>
   <?php echo $closure; ?>
</code>

Q: After upgrading to 5.x-1.2, the menu item 'administer' is no longer removed.
   Why?

A: Prior to release 5.x-1.2, Drupal Administration Menu was output via
   hook_block(), which allowed to alter the global menu array. Since 5.x-1.2, it
   is output via hook_footer() and thus no longer able to alter the menu. As
   long as there will be no built-in solution in an upcoming release, you may
   perform the following steps as a workaround:
   - Create a new menu.
   - Edit the menu item 'administer' and select the new menu as parent.

Q: I enabled "Aggregate and compress CSS files", but I found admin_menu.css is
   still there, is it normal?

A: Yes, this is the intended behavior. Since admin_menu is only visible for
   logged-on administrative users, it would not make sense to load its
   stylesheet for all, including anonymous users.


-- THEME-SPECIFIC TROUBLESHOOTING --

No more troubleshooting since release 5.x-1.2. :)
